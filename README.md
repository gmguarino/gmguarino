- My work has been recently focussed on time series classification and prediction using machine learning.
- I am still very interested in physics and the application of AI and Machine Learning to analyse correlated systems (more work on this soon).
- I find Quantum Computing very interesting.
- If you are interested in collaborating feel free to contact me in any way or form!

My technologies:
- Python
- Pytorch and Tensorflow
