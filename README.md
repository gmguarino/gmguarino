## Good Morning GitHub! :octocat:

Welcome to my profile, I hope you enjoy the work I have done and, if you have any questions, feel free to open an issue and @mention me!

### About me:

- I am a physicist who is now working on machine learning in healthcare!
- My work has been recently focussed on time series classification and prediction using machine learning.
- I am still very interested in physics and the application of AI and Machine Learning to analyse correlated systems (more work on this soon).
- If you are interested in collaborating feel free to contact me in any way or form!

My technologies:
- Python :snake:
- Pytorch :fire: and Tensorflow
- C/C++
